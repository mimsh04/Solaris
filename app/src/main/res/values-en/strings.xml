    <string name="installation_label_guide">Installation\nGuide</string>
    <string name="installation_self_install_subtitle">Can you install solar panels yourself?</string>
    <string name="installation_self_install_description">You cannot install solar panels yourself, except in certain cases. We strongly recommend using professionals for larger solar power installations for homes and cabins connected to the grid. This ensures that the installation is done correctly, without fire and health hazards. You can also feel safe that the solar cells are functioning optimally.</string>
    <string name="installation_when_self_install_subtitle">When can you install yourself?</string>
    <string name="installation_self_install_conditions">1. It is a standalone solar power installation\n2. You are not connected to the grid\n3. The solar power installation is under 50V and 200VA\n4. You do not wish to apply for Enova support</string>
    <string name="installation_mounting_steps_subtitle">Mounting – step by step</string>
    <string name="installation_step1_title">1. Assess the possibility of a solar power installation</string>
    <string name="installation_step1_description">Before installing solar panels, check if it is allowed in the municipality. Some places require an application or have restrictions. Also, make sure the roof is in good condition and has good solar exposure. A solar panel dealer can help you with the assessment.</string>
    <string name="installation_step2_title">2. Choose a dealer and installer</string>
    <string name="installation_step2_description">Choose a dealer and installer who collaborate for a smooth process. The dealer will help you find the right solar power installation, and most work with certified installers. This reduces the risk of misunderstandings and conflicts.</string>
    <string name="installation_step3_title">3. Mounting the panels</string>
    <string name="installation_step3_description">The installer first mounts suitable fixtures on the roof, adapted to the material and slope. Then the solar panels are securely fastened, so they can withstand both strong wind and heavy snow.</string>
    <string name="installation_step4_title">4. Safety and connection</string>
    <string name="installation_step4_description">The inverter makes the solar energy from your panels usable in your home\'s electrical outlets. The installer places the inverter in a suitable location and pulls cables from the panels, which are then connected to the inverter.</string>

    <string name="faq_have_question_text">Do you have any questions?</string>
    <string name="faq1_question">Why is this app being developed?</string>
    <string name="faq1_answer">The app aims to help users calculate the expected electricity production from solar panels based on local climate data, roof conditions, and solar cell efficiency.</string>
    <string name="faq2_question">How can solar cells work effectively in Norway?</string>
    <string name="faq2_answer">Although one might think that solar cells work best in warm climates, they are most effective at around -5°C and perform poorly at temperatures above 25°C. In Southern Norway, solar cells can actually produce more energy than in Africa, as long as there is no snow cover.</string>
    <string name="faq3_question">Can I get support for a solar panel installation?</string>
    <string name="faq3_answer">Enova offers support of up to NOK 32,500 for electricity production that can be fed back into the grid. It is also possible to get support for holiday homes.</string>
    <string name="faq4_question">Can I rely on the calculations in the app?</string>
    <string name="faq4_answer">The app is based on available data and documented calculation models, but the values may differ from actual conditions. It is always recommended to compare the results with multiple sources.</string>
    <string name="faq5_question">What is the difference between the different panels?</string>
    <string name="faq5_answer">Solar panel plates and solar roof tiles are the two most common types of solar cells in Norway. Solar panel plates are mounted on existing roofs and cost between NOK 2,500 and NOK 3,000 per m². They provide slightly more efficiency per panel than solar roof tiles but often cover a smaller part of the roof. Solar roof tiles replace regular roof tiles and cost between NOK 4,000 and NOK 5,000 per m². They are particularly beneficial for roof renovations, as they function both as a roof and as solar cells, which can result in total cost savings. They are also known for a more aesthetic and discreet appearance.</string>
